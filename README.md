## Contribution

### Git Branching

1. We generally follow [gitflow](https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/IntroducingGitFlow.html) for our branching and releases
2. We protect both Master and Develop branch for inadvertent code pushes

### Coding guideline

1. Please make sure to enable [editorconfig](https://editorconfig.org/) for your IDEA
2. Please try to make your pull requests and tasks as small as possible so the reviewer has easier time to understand the code.
3. More documentation in your code and readme fils are always appreciated.
